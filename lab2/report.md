## Introduction

The goal of this lab was to use observed data to determine the distance from Earth to a Cepheid variable star. This is accomplished through analyzing the light curve and luminosity curve, finding the apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude, and using this to calculate distance. This distance is then compared to the accepted distance below.

## Results

From the light curve above, I have determined that the pulsation period of "delta Cephei" to be <u>128</u> hours, or <u>5.333</u> days.

From the light curve, I have also determined the average apparent magnitude of "delta Cephei" to be m = <u>0.460</u>.

From the luminosity-period relation plot and use the pulsation period I have determined above, I estimate the absolute magnitude of "delta Cephei" to be M = <u>-3.367</u>.

Using the relation between apparent magnitude m and absolute magnitude M: $m - M = 2.5 \cdot log_{10}(\frac{d}{10})^{2}$, I have calculated the distance d to be <u>172.664</u> parsecs.

Looking up resources online (cite your source), the established value for the distance to "delta Cephei" is <u>271.986</u> parsec.
